**Whether full- or part-time, self-funded, GTA or TA, partly funded, UK-funded, internationally funded, on a visa, EU or UK citizen, with caring responsibilities, disabilities, pre-existing health conditions... We have started to organise to coordinate collective action that will ensure we are getting the support we need in face of the pandemic.**

This has not been the case. Instead universities across the UK have vastly differing, contradicting and incoherent policies towards PGRs. At many institutions, PGRs have been an afterthought. Most institutions hold the view that individualist approaches suffice. We have been speaking to PGRs across the country and beg to differ. Our aim is to get a coherent and responsible approach for all PGRs in this crisis that acknowledges the disruption to all PGR projects. We want blanket, funded extensions for all.

This is why we started to organise.
