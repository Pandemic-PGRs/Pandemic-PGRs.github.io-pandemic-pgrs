Pandemic PGRs is a grassroots collective of post-graduate researchers demanding fair conditions. The current pandemic has highlighted starkly how unjust and unequal PGR research is in the UK - but these issues did not begin with the pandemic, and they will not be solved when the pandemic ends.

The problems in post-grad reseach need major reform. It is through collective organisation and action that we will transform it.

Our main campaigns currently are fighting for adequate support for researchers affected by the pandemic and getting PGRs recognised as workers. We PGRs have organised around our experience of the dehumanising treatment of many researchers during the pandemic, which doesn't recognise the impact the pandemic is having on research, mental and physical health, and our ability to even complete our research. Those who are already disadvantaged have been affected the most. 

We aim to make post-graduate research a place for everyone, whatever your background, attributes or income, where researchers have good working conditions, job opportunities, and a recognition of the important role that our research plays. Join us and help to us make it happen.
