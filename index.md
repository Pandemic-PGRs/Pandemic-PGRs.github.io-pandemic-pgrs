Pandemic PGRs is a grassroots collective of post-graduate researchers demanding fair conditions. Our aims are to get funding and extensions for all PGRs who want them, for universities and other institutions to recognise the difficulties that PGRs face, and to provide adequate support. Aside from the pandemic, we also are campaigning with UCU to have PGRs recognised as workers (rather than students) and to build a network of support within the PGR community.
