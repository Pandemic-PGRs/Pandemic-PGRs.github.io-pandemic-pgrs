Much of our work over the last few months has been campaigning for blanket, unconditional extensions from the UKRI. Other workers have been furloughed, but PGRs were somehow expected to keep working. As well as this, we have started working with the UCU on PGRs Are Staff, a campaign to help PGR researchers get workers rights and protections that are currently unavailable. In the future, we will be looking to grow and campaign on other issues too.

However, we are focusing our attention at the moment on the Pandemic PGR campaign as this is currently of such major importance because the impact of the covid pandemic on PGR researchers has been huge.

The UK is already extremely unequal. Minorities are often excluded from higher education, and yet it is working class, first generation, disabled, chronically ill, neurodivergent, LGBTQI+, international, parents, carers, black and minority people that are impacted most from the covid crisis.

If you'd like to get involved, please sign up to our [email list](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?SUBED1=PGR-COVID19-ORGANISING&A=1). We have a number of WhatsApp groups too, from general discussion, to specific groups for parents and carers. Please contact us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/pandemicpgrs) for details of joining.
