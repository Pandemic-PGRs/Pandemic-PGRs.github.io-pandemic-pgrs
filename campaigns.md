Much of our work over the last few months has been campaigning for blanket, unconditional extensions from the UKRI. Other workers have been furloughed, but PGRs were somehow expected to keep working. As well as this, we have started working with the UCU on PGRs Are Staff, a campaign to help PGR researchers get workers rights and protections that are currently unavailable. In the future, we will be looking to grow and campaign on other issues too.

However, we are focusing our attention at the moment on the Pandemic PGR campaign as this is currently of such major importance because the impact of the covid pandemic on PGR researchers has been huge.

The UK is already extremely unequal. Minorities are often excluded from higher education, and yet it is working class, first generation, disabled, chronically ill, neurodivergent, LGBTQI+, international, parents, carers, black and minority people that are impacted most from the covid crisis.

If you'd like to get involved, please sign up to our [email list](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?SUBED1=PGR-COVID19-ORGANISING&A=1). We have a number of WhatsApp groups too, from general discussion, to specific groups for parents and carers. Please contact us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/pandemicpgrs) for details of joining.

## PGRs Are Staff

#### _Acknowledge postgraduate researchers as members of staff!_

At the end of September 2020, UCU’s Special Higher Education Sector Conference passed the following motion:

_“Covid-19 exposed the contradiction of PGRs being viewed as students rather than staff. Open letters revealed that PGRs' work was affected by the pandemic in the same way as members of staff; however, because of their student status, PGRs were unable to access neither employer nor government support such as benefits and furlough. Instead of being paid for their work, PGRs pay to do the work on which Universities and companies' profit. This is contrary to practice in other sectors (graduate training schemes) and countries, where PGRs would not be seen as students, but workers. The unpaid research labour of PGRs cements the expectation of unpaid labour throughout academic careers, which contributes to the workload and casualisation crisis in the sector._

_"HESC resolves to establish a principle that acknowledges original postgraduate research as labour like any other work at universities and resolves to campaign for PGRs to be recognised as members of staff.”_

The initial meeting discussing this motion, held on 25/11/2020, can be viewed here: [https://youtu.be/EFXs2Ikd0yk](https://youtu.be/EFXs2Ikd0yk "https://youtu.be/EFXs2Ikd0yk")

Benefits to PGRs from this campaign, if successful, include:

* The research being undertaken being recognised as work and contributing to academia;
* A salary commensurate with the duties of the role;
* Regular income so PGRs can concentrate on their PhD;
* Access to a pension scheme;
* Access to university policies and procedures;
* Employment rights including maternity and paternity leave and pay;
* Sick pay;
* Annual leave;
* Full union membership;
* Ability to attract the most talented and motivated students;
* Power in the workplace.

UCU also recognise a number of issues that need to be determined as part of this campaign, including: ensuring no detriment financially to PGRs; retaining benefits as a result of student status where possible; recognising the position of postdocs; ensuring access for international doctoral candidates is not reduced; ensuring there are no disadvantages for disabled doctoral candidates.

To realise our goals we will need to persuade the employers, government (including the home office), UKRI and other funders that treating PGRs as employees is the right thing to do.

It is important that the campaign is supported by PGRs both within UCU and those yet to join. All UCU members can help with this by talking about the issue with colleagues, getting involved in the campaign and encouraging PGR colleagues to join UCU and get involved.

**We will only be able to do that with a strong campaign behind us and with the majority of PGRs in UCU membership and actively campaigning for the change.**
