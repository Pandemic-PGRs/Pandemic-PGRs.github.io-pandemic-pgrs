PandemicPGRs has launched a report today (08 February 2021) outlining its response to the most recent policy from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) on support for postgraduate researchers (PGRs) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The report, [**_Falling Short_**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-6sBsboTyQ820axeJIFd8S4a2AOgSS5K/view?usp=sharing), details how UKRI has failed to offer sufficient or appropriate help to researchers who are being left behind in the current crisis.

UKRI’s [Phase 2 Doctoral Funding Extension Policy](https://www.ukri.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UKRI-11112020-COVID-19DoctoralExtensionsPolicyPhase2PolicyStatement.pdf) is inadequate. It disregards the needs PGRs have for funded extensions to be able to continue and complete their projects, and presents qualifying criteria for extensions which are unfair, inflexible, and non-inclusive.

The impact of UKRI’s decision will have a knock-on effect for researchers funded from other sources, and for self-funded researchers, as research institutions will use UKRI’s policy as a model for their own.

Take a look at our [**full report**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-6sBsboTyQ820axeJIFd8S4a2AOgSS5K/view?usp=sharing) and the [**executive summary**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uIBmqaGr5ahPqrmi5l_hDkaDcbTv8qOK/view?usp=sharing) for more info, and to see our recommendations for UKRI, government and universities.
