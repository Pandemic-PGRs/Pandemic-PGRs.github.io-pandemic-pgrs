If I had to try and isolate one of the biggest issues during the pandemic for me, it's that as a PhD with a respiratory illness I felt like I had no support. My PhD is heavily lab based and in the summer of 2020 we began phasing back into lab work but there was no consideration by the uni that some PhD students may be classed as vulnerable and when I raised my concerns I was mainly greeted with the idea of taking a leave of absence. Taking a leave of absence wasn't viable as I need my stipend for food and rent and I don't have family I can really rely on for financial support. My experience in this regards has felt like a slap in the face as the uni will outwardly say they're willing to support us but their support amounts to little more than suggesting a leave of absence. This combined with just the overall stress of trying to be productive and hit deadlines in the pandemic has just felt overall detrimental to my mental health but I felt like I had no option.
