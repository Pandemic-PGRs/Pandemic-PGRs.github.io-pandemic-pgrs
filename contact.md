Contact should be made with us on Twitter at [twitter.com/pandemicpgrs](twitter.com/pandemicpgrs) and we will respond as soon as possible.

If you are press wanting to talk about our campaigns, please tell us about the story you are writing so we can find the best person to speak to you.

If you'd like to get involved, please sign up to our [email list](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?SUBED1=PGR-COVID19-ORGANISING&A=1).
