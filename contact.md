Contact should be made with us on Twitter at [twitter.com/pandemicpgrs](twitter.com/pandemicpgrs) and we will respond as soon as possible.

If you are press wanting to talk about our campaigns, please tell us about the story you are writing so we can find the best person to speak to you.

If you are a PGR, you may find it more helpful to ask our [email list](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?SUBED1=PGR-COVID19-ORGANISING&A=1) or the WhatsApp group, but feel free to message us on Twitter for details.

For details on the parents and carers group, please contact the group at carerpandemicpgr @ gmail.com
